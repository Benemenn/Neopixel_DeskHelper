# NeoPixel DeskHelper

I thought of this project, to have a small light, that can be set up on my 
desk, without bothering or being a distraction.

The Deskhelper is in its basic version and can currently only have a 
breathing light and a run-through mode. This will be updated to other 
functionalities and better documentation.
